hello, your files have been encrypted :D

what do i do?
* to decrypt your files, you need a key. follow the instructions in the popup to make the payment.
* DO NOT rename any encrypted files. if you change the extension, decryption will not work (CHECK LATER IF THIS IS TRUE)

you have 12 hours to make a payment of $500NZD or your files will be deleted :o
please and thank youuu
