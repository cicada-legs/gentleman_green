If you're seeing this repo, you're probably a potential employer. hello :D

To Do:
- [ ] rename the project.

Current Issues:
* implement a way to not double-encrypt things
* add a way to reopen the terminal and enter a password if the user exits out (if check for if files are currently encrypted. same check as above)
- (solution: if encrypted.txt exists on the desktop (which contains a message saying to not delete it unless you want ot lost alll your stuff.) then just reopen the GUI and ask for password without running encryption again)
* persistence



Tips: public key to encrypt the symmetric key

read into a stream instead of reading massive files
